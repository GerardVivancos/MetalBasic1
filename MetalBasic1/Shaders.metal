/* Metal uses the [[...]] syntax to specify Metal specific annotations. We said that we want one parameter to be the vertex buffer, which means that Metal has to call this function and pass the vertex buffer as the first argument. But Metal does not know by itself which parameter of the vertex shader function it should pass the vertex buffer to, so writing [[buffer(0)]] is how we tell Metal that this specific parameter *vertices is where is should pass the first buffer. Note that the 0 here corresponds directly to the index: 0
 Similarly, Metal needs to pass the vertex ID to the vertex shader function, so writing [[vertex_id]] on the second parameter tells Metal where to pass the vertex ID  */
